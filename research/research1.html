<h2>Neural Author Name Dismabiguator</h2>
<p>In this research project, we explore a new method for disambiguating author names utilizng a simalarity learning frameowork. Author name disambiguation (AND) is crucial for accurately identifying unique authors in digital libraries, improving collaboration tools, and metascience studies.</p>

<p>Using techniques such as deep learning, clustering, and natural language processing, we aim to reduce errors and enhance the overall performance of author identification. Preliminary results show a significant improvement in accuracy when compared to traditional methods.</p>
